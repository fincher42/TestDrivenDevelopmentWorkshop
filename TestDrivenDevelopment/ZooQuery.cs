     Main Story Line:
     We just bought a zoo and employ jr. high students to write queries against our db for our web site.
     We see bad final queries like 
     https://WeBoughtAZoo.com/api&location=Asia
     https://WeBoughtAZoo.com/api&location=South America?type=reptile&pen=a2#4&time
         
        We need a helper URL builder function to make errors less likely, something like,
           string url = Utilities.BuildUrl(host, name1, value1, name2, value2, ....)
           See the comments at the top of UtilitiesTest.cs for more details.
